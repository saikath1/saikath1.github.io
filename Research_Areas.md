# S-Cube Research Vision: Software Reliability, Empirical Evidence, and Systems Engineering

## Motivation
The **Secured Software Systems Lab** is driven by a central mission: to advance the science and engineering of *reliable, secure, and evidence-based software systems*.
In a world where software controls critical infrastructure, autonomous platforms, and intelligent services, security and reliability are no longer separate concerns, they are two sides of the same assurance problem. Failures or vulnerabilities in software can propagate through complex software supply chains, interconnected devices, and cyber-physical systems such as IoTs, threatening both safety and trust.

Research in **Software Reliability**, **Empirical Software Engineering**, and **Systems Engineering** provides the foundation to address these challenges holistically. By systematically studying how software behaves in real world conditions  through repository mining, fault modeling, failure analysis, and controlled experimentation, we seek to identify patterns of failure, quantify risk, and design frameworks for *secure-by-design and reliable-by-evidence* systems.

<!-- ## Integration with Systems and Security Engineering
Modern dependability research must account for not just software defects, but also adversarial threats, architectural trade-offs, and human–machine interactions.
**Systems Engineering** brings the necessary system-level thinking, while **Security Engineering** ensures that reliability models remain robust under malicious conditions.
The **Secured Software Systems Lab** investigates topics such as:
- **Software Reliability**
- **Hardware Reliability**
- **Open-source Software Supply Chain Attacks in IoT and embedded platforms**
- **Software supply-chain security and SBOM analytics**
- **Risk and Threat Modeling of Cyber-physical systems**
- **Data-driven vulnerability  modeling** -->

## Research Thrusts
Our research agenda is structured around the following interconnected thrusts:

1. **Reliable and Resilient MLOps Systems** – Modeling, monitoring, and improving dependability in AI/ML-driven software pipelines.
2. **Empirical Software Assurance** – Using data-driven evidence from repositories, CI/CD pipelines, and runtime systems to quantify and enhance software reliability.
3. **IoT and Embedded Supply Chain Security** – Analyzing vulnerability evolution, package dependencies, and firmware assurance within embedded ecosystems.
<!-- 4. **Secure-by-Design Architectures** – Integrating reliability and security patterns into software and system design to promote long-term sustainability and trustworthiness. -->


By combining reliability modeling, empirical validation, and systems engineering our work advances the co-engineering of *security, safety, and sustainability* across the software lifecycle.

## Vision for Incoming Ph.D. Students
As a Ph.D. researcher in the **Secured Software Systems Lab**, you will help bridge the gap between *software reliability science* and *security assurance engineering*. You will conduct empirical studies to understand how software evolves and fails; design metrics and models that quantify reliability under uncertainty; and develop tools and frameworks that enhance the security and maintainability of real world systems.

Your research will be inherently interdisciplinary, integrating **empirical evidence**, **system modeling**, and **secure development practices** to build next-generation systems that are dependable by design and resilient by adaptation.

> **How can we build and assure software systems that remain secure, reliable, and adaptive as they evolve?**

*Secured Software Systems Lab – Advancing Reliability, Security, and Evidence-Based Engineering for the Next Generation of Software Systems.*

<!-- 
## Motivation
Software has become the invisible infrastructure of modern civilization — enabling critical systems in aerospace, healthcare, energy, transportation, and defense. As these systems grow in complexity and autonomy, reliability is no longer a static property but a continuously evolving attribute shaped by design decisions, operational environments, and human interaction. Failures in software-intensive systems can cascade across physical and cyber domains, emphasizing the urgent need for scientifically grounded methods to ensure dependability and resilience.

Research in **Software Reliability and Empirical Software Engineering** addresses this need by transforming software development into an evidence-based discipline. Through large-scale repository analysis, fault modeling, runtime monitoring, and controlled experimentation, we uncover *how and why software fails* — and more importantly, *how it can learn, adapt, and recover*. By drawing insights from operational data and developer behavior, empirical studies bridge the gap between theory and practice, guiding the design of reliable and maintainable systems that perform predictably in real-world contexts.

## Integration with Systems Engineering
Modern reliability challenges transcend software boundaries — they involve interactions among hardware, software, communication networks, and human operators. **Systems Engineering** provides the holistic perspective needed to manage this complexity. By integrating reliability modeling, architectural trade-offs, and lifecycle analysis, we can evaluate dependability as a *system property* rather than a component metric.

Ph.D. research in this space often spans topics such as **dependability modeling of cyber-physical systems**, **reliability growth in MLOps pipelines**, **fault propagation across embedded and IoT platforms**, and **co-engineering of hardware–software resilience**. This intersection enables researchers to design frameworks that not only detect or prevent failures but also quantify system-wide risk and guide sustainable engineering decisions.

## Vision for Incoming Ph.D. Students
As a doctoral researcher entering this domain, you will contribute to building the scientific foundations of reliable and adaptive software systems. You will employ empirical methods — mining open-source repositories, performing field studies, and conducting experiments — to generate reproducible evidence that informs reliability growth, maintenance strategies, and assurance frameworks. Your work will connect **data-driven discovery** with **system-level design**, enabling next-generation intelligent and resilient systems.

Ultimately, this research vision aims to advance a unifying question:

> **How can we build software-intensive systems that remain dependable as they evolve, learn, and interact with an uncertain world?**
