  <h1>Hello World!</h1>

  <p>I’m <strong>Saikath Bhattacharya</strong>, an Assistant Professor in the Computer Science and Software Engineering Department at the Milwaukee School of Engineering (MSOE). My academic journey is driven by a commitment to advancing secure, reliable, and cost-efficient software systems through both research and teaching.</p>

  <p>Prior to joining MSOE, I was a postdoctoral research scholar at the Science of Security Lablet at North Carolina State University, Dept. of Computer Science. I completed my Ph.D. in Computer Engineering at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth, where I was part of the Dependable Software and Systems Laboratory.</p>

  <p>My research interests lie at the intersection of empirical software engineering, software security testing, reliability engineering, cyber-physical systems, and system validation. My doctoral research focused on tradespace exploration and subsystem reliability investment strategies to reduce the lifecycle costs of complex systems such as rotorcrafts. I have also developed frameworks and cost-based metrics for evaluating Li-ion battery prognostics.</p>

  <p>I’m passionate about collaboration, mentorship, and exploring new applications of trustworthy software systems. Let’s connect if you’re interested in research partnerships, student engagement, or impactful innovation in secure software engineering.</p>
