# Hello World!

 I’m **Saikath Bhattacharya**, an Assistant Professor in the Computer Science and Software Engineering Department at the Milwaukee School of Engineering (MSOE). My academic journey is driven by a commitment to advancing secure, reliable, and cost-efficient software systems through both research and teaching.

Prior to joining MSOE, I was a postdoctoral research scholar at the Science of Security Lablet at North Carolina State University, Dept. of Computer Science. I completed my Ph.D. in Computer Engineering at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth, where I was part of the Dependable Software and Systems Laboratory.

My research interests lie at the intersection of empirical software engineering, software security testing, reliability engineering, cyber-physical systems, and system validation. My doctoral research focused on tradespace exploration and subsystem reliability investment strategies to reduce the lifecycle costs of complex systems such as rotorcrafts. I have also developed frameworks and cost-based metrics for evaluating Li-ion battery prognostics.

I’m passionate about collaboration, mentorship, and exploring new applications of trustworthy software systems. Let’s connect if you’re interested in research partnerships, student engagement, or impactful innovation in secure software engineering.
