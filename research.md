# Research

My research focuses on the discovery, modeling, analysis, and application of mathematical concepts to enhance system and software security, as well as the testing and evaluation of secure systems.

This work is inherently interdisciplinary, integrating insights from various subfields of computer science, including software engineering, cybersecurity, and systems engineering. Additionally, it draws upon methodologies and principles from disciplines such as statistical modeling, reliability theory, and systems engineering. While the interdisciplinary nature of this research increases the initial complexity and effort required, it also ensures that the outcomes are broadly applicable and hold significant value across multiple domains.

A key objective of my research is to engage a diverse audience. In addition to publishing in specialized technical venues, I have actively sought to disseminate my findings through broader forums that cater to the wider computer science community. This approach aims to maximize the impact and accessibility of my work, fostering dialogue and collaboration across disciplines.

Here are some of the key areas of my research:
### Security and Privacy in Medical Devices
Security and privacy in medical devices are critical concerns due to the increasing reliance on connected devices in healthcare. Medical devices, such as pacemakers, insulin pumps, and imaging systems, often collect and transmit sensitive patient data, making them attractive targets for cyberattacks.

### Open Source Software Supply Chain Attacks on Embedded  Systems Software


The increasing reliance on open source software in embedded systems has made them attractive targets for attackers. Supply chain attacks can occur at various stages, including the development, distribution, and deployment of software components. Attackers may inject malicious code into open source libraries, compromise build processes, or exploit vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies.

### Software Security Testing

Software security testing is a critical aspect of ensuring the security and reliability of software systems. It involves the systematic evaluation of software applications to identify vulnerabilities, weaknesses, and potential threats that could be exploited by malicious actors. The goal of software security testing is to enhance the overall security posture of software applications and protect sensitive data from unauthorized access or breaches.

### Software Reliability Growth Models

Software reliability growth models (SRGMs) are mathematical models used to predict and analyze the reliability of software systems over time. These models are particularly useful in the context of software testing and maintenance, as they help estimate the number of remaining defects, the rate of defect discovery, and the overall reliability of the software as it evolves.
SRGMs are based on the assumption that software reliability improves as defects are discovered and fixed during the testing process. By analyzing historical defect data, these models can provide insights into the software's reliability growth, allowing developers and project managers to make informed decisions about testing strategies, release schedules, and resource allocation.

### Prognostics and Health Management
Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) is a field that focuses on the prediction of system health and performance over time. It involves the use of data analytics, machine learning, and statistical methods to monitor and assess the condition of systems, enabling proactive maintenance and decision-making.

### Tradespace Exploration

Tradespace exploration is a systematic approach to evaluating and analyzing the design space of complex systems. It involves exploring various design alternatives, trade-offs, and performance metrics to identify the most suitable solutions for a given set of requirements and constraints.
Tradespace exploration is commonly used in engineering and systems design, particularly in fields such as aerospace, defense, and automotive. It helps decision-makers understand the implications of different design choices, assess risks, and make informed decisions based on a comprehensive understanding of the design space.
