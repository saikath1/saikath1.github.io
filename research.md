# Research

Welcome to **Secured Software Systems Research Lab (S-Cube)**.

My research lies at the intersection of **software engineering**, **cybersecurity**, and **systems engineering**, with a focus on improving the **security**, **reliability**, and **resilience** of software systems. I develop mathematical models, empirical methods, and system-level approaches applicable to domains like **embedded systems**.


This interdisciplinary work draws from:

- Statistical modeling
- Reliability theory
- Software Engineering
- Cybersecurity
- Systems engineering
- Security testing and validation

A key goal of the lab is to engage with a broad audience, fostering impact through both technical publications and cross-disciplinary collaborations.

## Research Focus Areas

### Security and Privacy in Medical Devices
Investigating risks in networked medical devices focusing on ransomware, data protection, and resilience against cyber threats.

### Supply Chain Security in Embedded Systems
Analyzing vulnerabilities introduced by third-party and open-source components in embedded software ecosystems, targeting prevention and detection of supply chain attacks.

### Software Security Testing
Techniques to identify vulnerabilities and strengthen security assurance through automated and empirical testing approaches.

### Software Reliability Growth Models (SRGMs)
Modeling software fault discovery and reliability improvement over time to inform release planning and quality assurance.

### Reliability Theory
Developing models and methods to assess and enhance the reliability of software systems, particularly in safety-critical applications.

### Prognostics and Health Management (PHM)
Using predictive analytics and ML to monitor and assess software/system health for proactive maintenance and fault prediction.
